      <h3>Your comment tracking number</h3>
      <div>
        The first step EPA takes is to assign your comment a tracking number.
        This page automatically displays that number when received:
      </div>
      <div class="status">
        Waiting to receive comment tracking number. This may take a few seconds
        or minutes.
      </div>
      <div>
        Your comment tracking number can help you find and view your public
        comment later if you want to.
      </div>

      <h3>What will happen to your comment</h3>
      <h4>EPA will process it and in most cases will post it publicly</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          EPA will process your comment, which may take a few days or weeks depending
          on the number of comments received. In a few cases EPA may decline to evaluate
          or post your comment, as listed in its
          <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules" target="_blank">
            rules and restrictions for comments
          </a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          In most cases, EPA will post your comment to
          <a href="#" target="_blank">the docket folder for this proposed rule</a>.
          Then you will be able to find your comment there or by searching
          <a href="https://www.regulations.gov" target="_blank">Regulations.gov</a>
          for your comment tracking number or keywords from your comment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>EPA will review eligible comments and will usually publish a final rule</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After this comment period ends, EPA will review the comments, and usually
          EPAâ€™s next step is to prepare a final rule that includes responses to major
          comments. EPA may decide to not go through with preparing a final rule,
          although this is unusual.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you'd like to hear about the potential final rule, you can
