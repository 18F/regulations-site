    <h3>What will happen to your comment</h3>
    <h4>EPA will process it and in most cases will post it publicly</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        EPA will process your comment, which may take a few days or weeks depending
        on the number of comments received. In a few cases EPA may decline to evaluate
        or post your comment, as listed in
        <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules" target="_blank">
          its rules and restrictions for comments <span class="cf-icon cf-icon-external-link"></span>
        </a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In most cases, EPA will post your comment to
        <a href="#" target="_blank">the docket folder for this proposed rule <span class="cf-icon cf-icon-external-link"></span></a>.
        Then you will be able to find your comment there or by searching
        <a href="https://www.regulations.gov" target="_blank">Regulations.gov <span class="cf-icon cf-icon-external-link"></span></a>
        for your comment tracking number or keywords from your comment.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>EPA will review eligible comments and will usually publish a final rule</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        After this comment period ends, EPA will review the comments, and usually
        EPAâ€™s next step is to prepare a final rule that includes responses to major
        comments. EPA may decide to not go through with preparing a final rule,
        although this is unusual.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you'd like to hear about the potential final rule, you can
